# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the daily bike rental demand based on environmental and seasonal factors such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately forecasts rental counts to help bike-sharing companies optimize operations and manage resources efficiently.

## Objectives

-Understand patterns and seasonal trends in bike rental data.
-Build and evaluate regression models to predict daily demand.
-Identify key factors influencing rental counts.

## Techniques Used

-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical features.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed trends, correlations, and distributions of key attributes.
-Model Building: Implemented and compared algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LightGBM.
-Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as R² Score, RMSE, and MAE to assess model performance.

## Tools & Libraries

-Python
-Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Scikit-learn, LightGBM
-Jupyter Notebook

## Results

-Achieved R² score: 0.89, indicating strong predictive performance.
-LightGBM performed best after hyperparameter tuning.
-Insights showed temperature, humidity, and working days as top predictors of demand.

## Visualizations

-Include sample visuals here (optional):
-Correlation heatmap
-Monthly rental trends
-Actual vs Predicted bike counts

## Key Insights

-Bike rentals peak during warmer months and weekdays.
-Weather and temperature significantly impact daily demand.
-Machine learning models can provide reliable demand forecasts for business decisions.
